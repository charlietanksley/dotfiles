h1. Dotfiles

No surprises here--this repository is home to all the .* files in my home directory.  Well, not quite.  It houses neither those files that contain passwords nor those files that I do not share between computers (like my .gvimrc).  But it contains all the major players.

h1. My .vim directory

I overhauled my .vim directory on 21 September 2010.  I finally decided to join the bandwagen and start using pathogen to manage my plugins.  The main motivation is the ability to update and/or remove plugins more easily.

To that end, I've opted to use the github versions of all plugins (either directly from the author or via the very helpful "vim-scripts":https://github.com/vim-scripts on github) and use git submodules to include them here.  I don't know exactly how updating them will work, nor do I quite understand yet how to delete a submodule, but I can figure all that out when the time comes.  This is the strategy for now.

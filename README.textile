h1. Dotfiles

No surprises here--this repository is home to all the .* files in my home directory.  Well, not quite.  It houses neither those files that contain passwords nor those files that I do not share between computers (like my .gvimrc).  But it contains all the major players.

h1. My .vim directory

I overhauled my .vim directory on 21 September 2010.  I finally decided to join the bandwagen and start using pathogen to manage my plugins.  The main motivation is the ability to update and/or remove plugins more easily.

To that end, I've opted to use the github versions of plugins whenever possible, and rather than using git submodules, I opted to use git subtrees for these plugins.  I haven't updated any plugins this way, so this may fall apart.  But, for my own records when I try to add a new plugin, here is how this works (this comes from ??Pro Git?? Chapter 6 (pp. 171-172), though the terrible naming strategy is my own:

bc.. $ git remote add remote_plugin-name http://github...
$ git fetch remote plugin-name

$ git branch remote_plugin-name_branch remote_plugin-name/master
$ git read-tree --prefix=.vim/bundle/plugin-name/ -u remote_plugin-name_branch

p. That should do it.  At least.  That has done it in the past.  How to handle updates?  That is too be determined.
